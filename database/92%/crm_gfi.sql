Figure XII: System Workflow of the Checkpoint Monitoring System

Explanation: The diagram illustrates the workflow of the Checkpoint Monitoring System, detailing the interaction between the user, administrator/staff, and the system itself. The process begins with the administrator/staff receiving profiling requests, encoding violations, or registering patrol bases. Users are involved by inserting personal information into the system and can request to print certificates. The core system processes these inputs and commands, facilitating smooth monitoring and management of checkpoint activities.


Figure XII: Level 1 Data Flow Diagram of the Checkpoint Monitoring System

This diagram represents the Level 1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Checkpoint Monitoring System, outlining the interactions and data flows between the user, administrator/staff, and the system. The process initiates when the administrator/staff receives profiling requests from users. They then encode violations and register patrol bases into the system. Users input their personal information directly into the system, which allows them to request the printing of certificates. The central system processes these data inputs and commands, ensuring efficient monitoring and management of checkpoint operations.
